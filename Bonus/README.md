# Approach

### 1) First of all we scraped the captcha image using Selenium and saved it in our directory.

### 2) Later we use Python's `pytesseract` library to extract the text from the image and print it.

### 3) Thus we can use the text to solve the captcha.

### NOTE: This method has low success rate.
